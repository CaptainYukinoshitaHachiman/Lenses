 In this playground, an arrow means an image.

/*:
 Here are two images, one drawn in real line and the other one in dotted line.
 
 > The one drawn in real line is called a _real image_, which forms when two light rays converge. A real image can be seen on a screen.
 >
 > And the other one is called a _virtual image_, it got the name because a virtual image can't be seen on a screen. A virtual image is formed at the two light rays' reversed extension lines' intersection.
 
 - Callout(About objects...):
 We use an arrow to express an object, just like a real image
 \
 (Well, if you try to dig out the code, you'll find they are actually the same class)
 
 Maybe it sounds abstract, but don't worry. You'll see how the two kinds of images form in the next page.

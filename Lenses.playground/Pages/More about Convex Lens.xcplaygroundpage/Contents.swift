 Have you see the points 2F, F and O? These are the principle points of a lens. Here we are introducing them:
 
 The center of the lens is the _optial center_, _O_.
 
 The horizontal dash dotted line passing the optical center, is the _principle axis_.
 
 The distance from the optical center, of a lens to its focal point, is the _focal length_, _f_.
 
 The distance from its _2F_ point to its optical center is double the focal length.

 # Parallel Light Rays
 > A convex lens causes rays of light to converge.
 >
 > Lines with arrows are the rays of light
 >
 > Especially, when rays of light are parallel to the principle axis, they will assemble at a point. We call points like this a _focal point_, _F_. A lens has 2 focal points. Here's an example.
